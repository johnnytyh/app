<H2>About the app</H2>
The app name ‘The Money Tree’ is designed to provide a fuss-free way for young adults to learn about personal finance and how to save money. 
<H2>Login page</H2>
When the app is launched, the user will arrive on the Login page and may click on the Help button, if necessary, where a Dialog box will pop up.



Next, the user will click on okay, creating a toast.  Afterward, the user will follow the login instructions and proceed to Login, leading the user to the main menu. 
<H2>Main Menu</H2>
 
On the main menu, the user may choose to click on the categories to move forward or press the back button on the top left to back to the Login page. There will be 4 main categories- Lesson, Test, Savings quiz, and Notes. An additional feature will be maps. On each of the categories, there is a back button to go back to the dashboard menu along with instructions.
<H2>Lesson</H2>
The lesson page is straightforward, for users to learn about personal finance and how to save money, with a back and ok button for users to navigate back to the main menu.
   

<H2>Quiz and Test</H2>
Quiz and test both use radio groups to determine if the user clicked the right answer. If it is wrong, it will display try again. If it is right, the ok button will appear, and the user may proceed to return to the main menu. 
<H2>Notes</H2>
Under the notes page, users may record notes learned from lessons or quizzes so that they can reopen it even if the app was to close. This is because SQLlite was used to set up a database.
<H2>Maps</H2>
Maps are used to identify and record all the places with good for valuable items or the cheapest food so that one can have an overview and plan out their budget.
